# TEM_cell_seg
The code for a convolutional neural network that segments nuclei from TEM images of cells, created for the study presented in the paper "Employing Deep Networks for Image Processing on Small Research Datasets". 
This neural network was tested on human cheek cell TEM micrographs. The model employs data augmentation through random transformations, with a maximum accuracy of 95% with only 500 training examples.
